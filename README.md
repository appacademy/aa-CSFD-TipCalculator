## Introduction

In this exercise, you will write a tip calculator program.

## Instructions

Create a simple application that takes in an amount (decimal) and desired tip percentage (as a whole number) and then outputs the appropriate tip. Use string interpolation and format codes to make the values look nice!

Food for thought: What is the fewest number of variables you can use to accomplish this?

## Sample Output

```console
Enter the amount: 100.00
Enter the tip percentage: 15
For an amount of $100.00 a 15.00% tip would be $15.00 totalling $115.00.
```
